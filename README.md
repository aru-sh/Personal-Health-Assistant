We developed a website which can detect over 450 diseases of a person based on symptoms entered. The heart of the project was the Disease Identification and Prediction (DIP) algorithm. The main objective was to create a fast, easy and efficient algorithm. The project was further extended to connect modules for fixing an appointment with a choice of over 700 doctors and buying medicines from nearly 60 pharmacy stores in Chennai.
